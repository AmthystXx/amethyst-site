        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a Beat Saber player and custom mapper (as you may have seen from my youtube), and I also make Minecraft datapacks. I also love programming, which is why I chose to make this website with raw code rather than something like google sites. ðŸ˜…<br><br>If you want to play my Beat Saber maps, you can find them on my <a href="https://beatsaver.com/profile/151745">Beatsaver</a>, and if you want to find my Minecraft datapacks, you can find them on my <a href="https://modrinth.com/user/AmethystXx_">Modrinth</a>!</p>
